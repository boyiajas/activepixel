        notice and to suspend or terminate the publication. By placing his/her order via the online form, in writing or
        over the telephone specifying the size and the number of the desired photos the purchaser makes a binding offer.

    <h5>5. Prices</h5>

    <p>The photos will be supplied at the prices valid on the day on which the contract is concluded and indicated on
        the website of Active Pixel. The final price is composed of the order value and all applicable shipping charges
        and/or taxes. All prices are based on ZAR South African Rands. If the merchandise is purchased by countries
        outside RSA, clearance charges and/or taxes which are outside the control of Active Pixel may be charged. Any
        such clearance charges and/or taxes are to be paid by the purchaser.</p>

    <p>Unless otherwise agreed by the purchaser and Active Pixel, delivery of the ordered merchandise will be made
        according to the regulations stated on the website. Delivery will be made at the purchaser’s expense and risk.
        Active Pixel may deliver the merchandise by instalments. The purchaser may not claim damages for any default of
        delivery on the part of Active Pixel unless the default is caused intentionally or by gross negligence.</p>

    <h5>7. Responsibility</h5>

    <p>Active Pixel takes responsibility for all aspects relating to the transaction including sale of goods and
        services sold on this website, customer service and support, dispute resolution and delivery of goods.</p>

    <h5>8. Payment, Card acquiring and security</h5>

    <p>The purchaser may pay by credit card, or by debit card. Payment is considered to be made on the day on which
        Active Pixel has the money at its disposal. In the event of default by the purchaser Active Pixel is entitled to
        charge default interest according to the statutory rate of interest. If any additional provable loss should be
        incurred as a result of the default, damages can also be claimed for this loss. If it should be impossible to
        debit the purchaser’s account due to insufficient cover or incorrect banking details, the purchaser will have to
        reimburse the handling fees incurred for the return debit and all other damages and expenses to Active Pixel. 
        Card transactions will be acquired for Active Pixel via Payfast who are the approved payment gateway
        for all South African Acquiring Banks. Payfast uses the strictest form of encryption, namely Secure Socket Layer
        3 (SSL3) and no Card details are stored on the website. Users may go to payfast.io to view their security
        certificate and security policy.</p>

    <h5>9. Customer details separate from card details</h5>
    <p>Customer details will be stored by Active Pixel separately from card details which are entered by the client on
        Payfast’s secure site. For more detail on Payfast refer to Payfast.io</p>

    <h5>10. Offsetting</h5>

    <p>The purchaser may only offset debits against credits if his/her counterclaims are legally enforceable or not
        contested by Active Pixel.</p>

    <h5>11. Exchange and refund</h5>

    <p>Digital photo orders are non-refundable.</p>

    <h5>12. Reservation of ownership</h5>

    <p>Until all items covered by the same order are fully paid, the merchandise remains the property of Active Pixel.
    </p>

    <h5>13. Rights on the pictures</h5>

    <p>The copyright on the pictures as well as all industrial property rights, publishing rights, and utilization
        rights remain exclusively with Active Pixel. The purchase of a picture does not involve the explicit or implicit
        cessation of any rights. Any publication or other commercial use of the purchased pictures requires the previous
        written permission of Active Pixel.</p>

    <h5>14. Reproduction</h5>

    <p>The purchaser is aware of the fact that due to the diversity of electronic display devices it is impossible to
        reproduce the photos absolutely true to the original. Therefore the electronic pictures can only convey an
        approximate impression of the original picture. The original pictures may in some cases differ significantly
        from the electronic sample in terms of sharpness, richness of detail, contrast, and colour. The reduced size,
        the inevitable screening, and the limitation to a web-compatible grey and colour scale can change the impression
        of sharpness. Furthermore features such as the granularity of the image cannot be depicted in the samples.</p>

    <h5>15. Warranty for defects</h5>

    <p>An item is considered defective if it does not meet the technical standard for digital photo and image
        processing. The purchaser will have to give notice of any patent defects of the delivered merchandise
        immediately upon delivery. In case of hidden defects the purchaser will have to give notice immediately after
        their detection within the statutory warranty period of 24 months. In the event of a justified complaint Active
        Pixel may at first make a substitute delivery. If such a substitute delivery should be impossible or fail, the
        purchaser will be entitled to demand the cancellation of the contract or a reduction of the purchase price. If
        the purchaser decides to withdraw from the contract, he/she will have to return all items to Active Pixel, 14
        Bamboo Lane, New Germany, South Africa. Apart from this, warranty is given according to the regulations of the
        purchase law.</p>

    <h5>16. Liability</h5>

    <p>The liability of Active Pixel is limited to defects of the merchandise itself occurring prior to the dispatch of
        the order. The purchaser may not lodge any claims going beyond the above on any legal basis whatsoever. In
        particular Active Pixel accepts no liability for delayed delivery nor for any damage or loss on the purchaser’s
        own data carriers, the data carriers of Active Pixel, any networks or during electronic data transmission.
        Active Pixel does not give any guarantee as to the qualities of the products. It only accepts the liability for
        any guaranteed qualities if it has explicitly given such guarantee in writing. The above limitation of liability
        does not apply to cases of gross negligence or wilful misconduct on the part of Active Pixel.</p>

    <h5>17. Data privacy/ data protection/ Privacy Policy</h5>

    <p>The purchaser knows and agrees that his/her personal data which is required to process and handle the order is
        stored on data carriers. He/she explicitly permits the capture, processing, and use of his/her personal data.
        The data processing will be carried out according to current Data Privacy Law. All data will be kept
        confidential by Active Pixel.  The purchaser may revoke his/her permission at any time with immediate effect for
        the future. Active Pixel undertakes to delete the personal data immediately if the permission is revoked unless
        the order transaction has not been fully completed. Active Pixel shall take all reasonable steps to protect the
        personal information of users. For the purpose of this clause, "personal information" shall be defined as

    <p>Active Pixel can only be held liable for any direct or indirect references to third-party websites (hyperlinks)
        which are outside its control if Active Pixel is aware of any possible illegal content and has the technical
        possibility and can reasonably be expected to prevent access to such illegal content. Active Pixel hereby

        become invalid, this shall not affect the validity of the remaining clauses which will still be binding on both
        parties. In this case the parties hereto will try to agree on an alternative ruling allowing for the mutual

        of the invalid provision.</p>
